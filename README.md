### Project Title:
#### Telcome-Customer-Churn_Analysis
### Project Description:
#### The "Telco Customer Churn Analysis" typically involves analyzing customer data from a telecommunications company to understand why customers are leaving (churning) and to identify patterns that could predict future churn.This analysis helps businesses reduce churn rates by taking proactive steps to retain at-risk customers.Customer churn is a significant issue for big business companies. Companies are attempting to create methods for predicting customer churn to get a direct impact on getting more revenues, particularly in telecom companies. Finding these characteristics is crucial to ensure appropriate steps can be taken to reduce customer churn.

### The data set includes information about:
#### 1. Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
#### 2. Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
#### 3. Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
#### 4.Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

### Conclusion:
#### The Telco Customer Churn dataset we have demonstrated an end-to-end machine learning project from beginning to end. Data cleaning and visualization were our first steps. Then, to give better data to train with the machine learning model we have to change categorical data to numerical data and we scale the numerical data (feature engineering). After that, we tried to build three machine-learning models and we evaluated that. Logistic regression has a high accuracy compared with Neural Networks and KNN. The ability to recognize potential customer scenarios where churn can be prevented requires a high level of accuracy since the benefits of the customer’s eventual returns must balance the expenses of associated retention initiatives.
